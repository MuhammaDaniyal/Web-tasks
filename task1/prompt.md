"Act as a Senior Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer. I am building Catallery. I will provide detailed specs for each section. Your goal is to provide clean, semantic HTML5, modern CSS (using Flexbox/Grid), and vanilla JavaScript for interactions. All designs must be accessible (WCAG) and mobile-first. Do you understand the brand identity (Gold/Black/Teal-Green, Premium Feline Art)?"

"Create the best possible version of a website called 'Catallery,' an exquisite digital art gallery dedicated to premium feline portraits. The theme is elegant, playful, and cat-centric, celebrating art, creativity, and timeless cat expressions. Make it visually stunning, user-friendly, responsive for mobile/desktop, SEO-optimized, and accessible (follow WCAG guidelines). Incorporate modern web design best practices like fast loading, smooth animations, and secure forms. Enhance the design for maximum engagement, such as subtle cat-themed Easter eggs or hover effects on images.
Overall Structure:

Use descriptive placeholder URLs from Unsplash or a similar service that match the cat descriptions (e.g., https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?tuxedo-cat).
You have to make :root for the fonts and colors which will be used for dynamic color changing.

Use a consistent color palette: Gold (#FFD700) for accents/buttons/text highlights, black (#000000) for dark sections/backgrounds, light gray/beige (#F0F0F0) for light backgrounds, teal-green (#008080) for hero sections.
Fonts: Bold sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat) for headings in gold, clean serif (e.g., Playfair Display) for body text in white/black.
Navigation: Sticky top bar with menu icon (three lines in gold circle), links to Home, About, Gallery, Feedback, Sign In/Sign Up.
Footer: Black background with 'Catallery' logo, copyright '© 2026 Catallery. All rights reserved.', and navigation links.

Key Pages/Sections Based on Provided Screenshots:

Yellow-gold 'Explore Collection' button below, leading to Gallery.
Subtle animation: Cat eyes blink or whiskers twitch on hover.

Sign In/Sign Up Page:
Light gray background, centered black rounded box with gold 'Sign In' title.
Form fields: Email (placeholder 'Enter your email'), Password (placeholder 'Enter your password'), yellow-gold 'SIGN IN' button.
Link below: 'Don't have an account? Sign up' in gold.
Integrate secure authentication (suggest using email/password or OAuth).

Gallery Page:
Light gray background, large black 'GALLERY' title, subtitle 'Our Featured Products' in gray.
Responsive grid (3-6 columns depending on screen size) of cat portrait images: Include examples like a snowy black cat close-up, kitten in hat, hooded cat, cats in costumes (pink scarf, black hood), fluffy white cat, blue-eyed white cat.
Each image: Rounded corners, hover zoom/overlay with 'View Details' button leading to modal with larger image, artist info, and purchase/download option.
Infinite scroll or pagination for more images; categorize by themes (e.g., 'Cute', 'Majestic').
The Gallery should use a CSS Grid with grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)) to ensure it looks perfect on all screen sizes.


Enhancements to Make It the Best:

Add user features: After sign-in, allow favoriting images, commissioning custom cat art, or newsletter signup.
Performance: Optimize images for web (compress to <100KB), use lazy loading.
SEO: Include meta tags, alt text for all images (e.g., 'Premium tuxedo cat portrait'), and a sitemap.
Accessibility: High contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader-friendly labels.
Mobile Optimization: Stack sections vertically, touch-friendly buttons.
Creative Touches: Background cat paw prints fading in, or random cat fact pop-ups.

Output the full website design specs, including HTML structure outline, CSS styles, and any JS for interactivity. Suggest improvements like adding a search bar for cat breeds or e-commerce integration for selling prints. Ensure it's fun, immersive, and the ultimate cat art experience!"

For the Easter egg, include a JS function that plays a subtle 'purr' sound or shows a paw-print cursor when the user hovers over the Logo for more than 2 seconds."
